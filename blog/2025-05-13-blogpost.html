                <h2>Getting Off the Airplane</h2>
                <p>I finally woke up from my 3 hour slumber on the airplane. I did not get a good sleep as the seats were uncomfortable. However, when we finally touched down, I grabbed my bags and headed for the exit to meet with Katie and Ryan. We met with Professor Pascale at the entrance and headed to the bus station!</p>
                
                <h2>Seeing My Hotel</h2>
                <p>As we headed from the bus station, we went to the hotel where we got our keycards and checked in! My hotel was very nice with decent space but a small bathroom. It is okay though :O I will manage.</p>
                
                <h2>Grabbing Food and Walking Around with Ryan</h2>
                <p>Now that I am at the hotel, Ryan and I decided to go to the supermarket to find his childhood favorite snacks which is a cheese dip cracker that needs to be refrigerated? Upon discovery that our hotel rooms do not provide a refrigerator, we gave up and went to the cafe next to us to grab a sandwich. Then, I headed back to the hotel with Ryan and showered and took a nap.</p>
                
                <h2>Walking Around with the Others</h2>
                <p>I woke up from my nap at roughly 4:57PM to Ryan knocking on my door. Thankfully, without Ryan I think I still would have been asleep by now. We headed out to walk around Nice with everybody and I took a lot of photos ! It was beautiful to see the sea and all the charming little spots around nice. We also stopped for some ice cream in which I got some guava flavoured ice cream. It was very delicious. We then split up and I headed with the girls to grab some dinner ! I got some pasta and wine and it was absolutely delish. That is my day for today !!</p>
                
                <h2>En Francais ?</h2>
                <p>J'ai choisi cette photo car elle montre le premier repas que j'ai mangé avec Ryan chez Brioche Dorée.                </p>
